To start off, I'm going to be using `pnpm` for this due to its workspace 
feature. There are other ways to do this, but `pnpm` has been my favorite
so far and it seems to work for what I'm trying to do here.

If you do not already have pnpm installed, but already have Node installed you
can run the following command to install pnpm:

```bash
corepack enable
```

Now make a folder and initialize a new project:

```bash
mkdir my-animation
pnpm init
```

I'm going to create two outputs; one to just play the animation, and one to
play the animation as a presentation. That needs to be in a separate project
in order to build the animation properly, so I'm going to add a folder for it:

```bash
mkdir web
```

And create a new animation in the animations folder. I found I didn't need the
ffmpeg exporter for what I was doing, but you can use what you please:

```bash
npm create @motion-canvas@latest -- --name animations --path ./animations --language ts
cd animations
pnpm i
```

I'm going to add both to my pnpm workspace so that they can resolve each other:

```yaml title="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
packages:
  - "./animations"
  - "./web"
```

Now I'm going to add some animations and projects to my animations project:

```bash
cd animations/src/scenes
touch circle.tsx
touch square.tsx
cd ..
touch circle-project.tsx
touch square-project.tsx
```

Next I'll add a dependency on `glob` so that I can resolve all of the projects
at once in the animations' `vite.config.ts`:

```bash
pnpm i -S glob
```

Then I'll make some changes to the `vite.config.ts` to automatically find all
of the projects in the `src/projects` folder. Each one will need to contain
their own project.:

```ts {7-9} title="animations/vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import motionCanvas from "@motion-canvas/vite-plugin";
import { globSync } from "glob";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    motionCanvas({
      project: globSync("./src/*project.ts"),
    }),
  ],
});
