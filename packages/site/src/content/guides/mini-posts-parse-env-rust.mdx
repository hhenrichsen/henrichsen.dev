Almost every app I write nowadays uses an environment file, and therefore I 
always have to read things from the environment and parse them into different
forms. Doing this safely with defaults in Rust was a bit tricky for me at first,
but I've landed on a solution I like.

## Optional Numbers
The reason I was looking for code like this was to try and get a port for a
database from the environment with a reasonable fallback. Here's what I landed
on:

```rust title="main.rs"
use std::env;
use dotenv::dotenv;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();
    let count = env::var("COUNT")
        // convert to Option<String>
        .ok() 
        // convert to Option<u64> via parse
        .and_then(|value| value.parse::<u64>().ok())
        // Use 5 as a default if either the value was not found or it could
        // not be converted.
        .unwrap_or(5)
    
    println!("{}", count * 5);
}
```

## Default Strings
Of course, you can always just get a required value like this:

```rust title="main.rs"
std::env;
use dotenv::dotenv;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();
    let test = env::var("TEST")
        .unwrap_or(String::from("Test"));
    
    println!("{}", test);
}
```

## Required Environment Variables
And of course, you can make them required by just `unwrap`ing them, but that
will crash your program:

```rust title="main.rs" showLineNumbers
std::env;
use dotenv::dotenv;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();
    let test = env::var("TEST").unwrap();
    
    println!("{}", test);
}
```

```console
thread 'main' panicked at src\main.rs:6:35:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: NotPresent
```

You can instead print a helpful message:

```rust title="main.rs" showLineNumbers
std::env;
use dotenv::dotenv;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();
    let test = env::var("TEST");
    
    match test {
        Ok(test) => {
            println!("{}", test)
        }
        Err(_) => {
            eprintln!("Missing required environment variable 'TEST'");
            return;
        }
    }
}
```

```console
Missing required environment variable 'TEST'
```
