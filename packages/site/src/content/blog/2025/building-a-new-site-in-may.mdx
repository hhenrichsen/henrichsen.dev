import DarkToggle from "../../../components/core/DarkToggle.astro";
import Animation from "../../../components/mdx/Animation.astro";
import ExampleAnimationUrl from "@henrichsen.dev/animations/dist/src/example.project.js?url"

*All because someone asked for an RSS feed...*

Things picked up for me a lot in April, so it's now May. I've been slowly 
chugging along on my [blog challenge](/blog/2025/april-blog-challenge), and I've 
finally made some progress. One of my friends asked me to add an RSS feed to my
site, and that was the final straw that pushed me to sit down and do the work.

I decided to switch from Hugo to Astro, since I 
couldn't quite get the features in Hugo that I wanted, especially to get
animations working in an ergonomic way. Plus, [Maggie Appleton's site](https://maggieappleton.com/)
is built with Astro, and I look up to her in a lot of ways.

## Animations

One of the things I wanted to do was build some new features into my site and 
update the design a little bit. For example, one thing I wanted to be able to do
was to embed animations from Motion Canvas in my posts:

<Animation src={ExampleAnimationUrl} caption="Example Animation" />

I also wanted to figure out how to toggle between light and dark mode, including
for the animations on the page. You can try clicking the button in the top right
to toggle the theme and see the animation update.

This was a pretty hacky solution, involving reading a bunch of variables from
the `:root` element and applying them to the animation. It works, but it's not
the best. It ended up looking something like this:

```astro title="src/components/mdx/Animation.astro"
---
const { src, caption, variables, auto = true, ...props } = Astro.props;
---

<figure>
  <motion-canvas-player
    src={src}
    variables={JSON.stringify(variables)}
    auto={auto}
    {...props}></motion-canvas-player>
  {caption && <figcaption>{caption}</figcaption>}
</figure>

<style>
  motion-canvas-player {
    width: 100%;
  }

  figure {
    background-color: var(--mantle);
    margin: 1em 0;
    border-radius: 1em;
    padding: 1em;
  }

  figcaption {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 0.8em;
    margin-top: 0.5em;
    font-style: italic;
  }
</style>

<script>
  // Side-effect, client-side imports
  import "@motion-canvas/player";
  import "@motion-canvas/core";

  const listenedColors = [
    "--text",
    "--subtext",
    "--surface",
    "--crust",
    "--mantle",
    "--red",
    "--peach",
    "--yellow",
    "--green",
    "--blue",
    "--sky",
  ];

  function updateVariables(values: Record<string, string>) {
    const motionCanvasPlayers =
      document.querySelectorAll(`motion-canvas-player`);
    motionCanvasPlayers.forEach((motionCanvasPlayer) => {
      const oldVariables = JSON.parse(
        motionCanvasPlayer.getAttribute("variables") || "{}"
      );
      const newVariables = { ...oldVariables, ...values };
      console.log(newVariables);
      motionCanvasPlayer.setAttribute(
        "variables",
        JSON.stringify(newVariables)
      );
    });
  }

  function readColors(element: HTMLElement) {
    const colors: Record<string, string> = {};
    listenedColors.forEach((color) => {
      colors[color] = window.getComputedStyle(element).getPropertyValue(color);
    });
    return colors;
  }

  const styleObserver = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
    if (!(mutations[0].target instanceof HTMLElement)) {
      return;
    }
    if (
      mutations[0].type !== "attributes" ||
      mutations[0].attributeName !== "class"
    ) {
      return;
    }
    const newValues = readColors(mutations[0].target as HTMLElement);
    updateVariables(newValues);
  });

  styleObserver.observe(document.documentElement, {
    attributes: true,
    attributeFilter: ["class"],
  });

  updateVariables(readColors(document.documentElement));
</script>
```

I then use these variables in the animation using a utility I made to pull them
from the project variables:

```ts title="src/util/colors.ts"
import { Colors } from "@hhenrichsen/canvas-commons";
import { Color, SignalValue, useScene } from "@motion-canvas/core";

const defaultColors: Record<string, string> = {
  "--text": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Text,
  "--subtext": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Subtext0,
  "--surface": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Surface0,
  "--crust": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Crust,
  "--mantle": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Mantle,
  "--red": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Red,
  "--peach": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Peach,
  "--yellow": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Yellow,
  "--green": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Green,
  "--blue": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Blue,
  "--sky": Colors.Catppuccin.Mocha.Sky,
};

export function getColors(): Record<
  keyof typeof defaultColors,
  SignalValue<Color>
> {
  return Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(defaultColors).map(([key, value]) => {
      return [key, () => new Color(useScene().variables.get(key, value)())];
    })
  );
}

```

*Shoutout to [Waldi's work here](https://github.com/WaldemarLehner/astro-motion-canvas-poc/)
for the initial implementation of the Motion Canvas player in Astro. Mine works
a little differently, but it's still based on his work.*

I'll likely end up making my own player component eventually, but this works for
most of what I want to do for now.

## Code and Design

If you haven't used the old site, I also took the opportunity to update the
design to use the Cappuccin colors, and decided to throw in the towel and use 
a [third party library for code blocks](https://expressive-code.com/), which 
has improved the terminal and code block experience a lot, I think. It also 
keeps the markdown content I use a lot simpler, which is nice since I do most of
my composition in Obsidian.

## Other Stuff

I've decided to collect some of the other work that I've been doing in the
background. These include my lecture notes, which I'm working on porting over
to this site, some of my creative writing, and some other ideas I want to steal
from other sites I've seen.
