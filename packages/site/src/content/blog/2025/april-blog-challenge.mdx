Hi. I want to tune up and give some attention to my blog site. I want you to do
it too, or take some time and learn how to put together a site for yourself.

I'm going to challenge myself to do the following things:

1. Redesign my site with a new theme and site generator.
1. Add a new feature to my site, probably support for motion canvas animations.
1. Set up a digital garden, so that I can put together some smaller posts that
   have been cooking for a while.
1. Write one useful blog post a week in April, using those features above.

I invite you to do similar. My general challenge would be:

1. Commit to the challenge, including which parts you want to do, on
   [Discord](https://discord.gg/2xhAGpP9Fc) in the #blog-challenge channel.
1. Create a blog site if you don't have one.
1. Add a new theme or feature to your website.
1. Write a blog post a week in April.
1. Publish your blog site; if you're using a static site generator, you can host
   it on GitHub Pages or Netlify for free.
1. Share your progress as you make it.
